Project Overview:
The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API 
to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities. After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude. Factors we looked at included: 
temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.

The website consists of the following:

* A landing page:
* Four visualizations (graphs) for 6/13/2018 for 500 cities (in Northern & Southern Hemispheres):
  - Latitude vs Max Temperature
  - Latitude vs Humidity
  - Latitude vs Cloudiness
  - Latitude vs Wind Speed
  * Included is a page for each graph and a comparison page, which includes all 4 graphs.
  * Dataset is also included
  
 General observations:
 * There is little to no correlation between latitude and weather (i.e., humidity, cloudiness and wind speed).
 * The temperature becomes significantly warmer as one approaches the equator.
 
 Resources:
 * Bootstrap - https://getbootstrap.com/
 * Jupyter Notebook
 * .CSV file via OpenWeather API
